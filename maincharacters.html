      <div class="angelicapickles" style="height:200px;"><img src="images/angelicapickles.jpeg" alt="angelicapickles" width="230"></div>
		<br>
		<h5>"You dumb babies!"</h5>
      <p>Angelica is often seen bullying and making fun of her cousins and their friends. Since she's older than the babies, who can only communicate with each other and Angelica, Angelica herself can communicate with the adults as well as the other Rugrats, which she uses to her advantage most of the time. Angelica is quite the manipulator, often playing sweet and innocent in front of adults, only to reveal her true colors the second their backs are turned and she is not being watched. Angelica is always referring to the babies as "just babies" and to herself as an adult, despite being only a year older than Chuckie, and two years older than Tommy.</p>

      <h2>Dil Pickles</h2>
      <h5>Voice by Tara Strong</h5>

	<br>
		<h5>"gee...yucka","poopy!",</h5>
      <p>Dil joined the Rugrats cast in 1999, his age was moved up to 3 months. His big brother Tommy feels that it's his "sponsability" to teach him about how things work in the world. Dil has a personality of a typical 3-month-old: all id. He wants everything NOW and will do whatever he can to get it. And once he does get it, he won't let go without a fight.</p>

		  <br>
		  <h5>"Hey! Leave them little kids alone!"</h5>
      <p>Susie was brought in as a "foil" to Angelica, as she is Angelica's biggest rival and helps the babies to stand up to Angelica, acting like a deuteragonist to them. Despite the rivalry, she does try to get along with Angelica, and tries to befriend her. Like Angelica, she has many toys, even some that Angelica doesn't have, much to Angelica's personal annoyance.
